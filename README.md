- Ethan Thompson
- Mary Fenberg

## Project overview
"The objective of the process control project is to control or optimize a system that is chosen by a student group of 3. The project can either be entirely simulation based or else involve a physical measurement and actuator (preferred) such as provided by a micro-controller (e.g. Arduino) or micro-processor (e.g. Raspberry Pi). The project must involve a sensor, actuator, and controller. The project is open-ended by design to allow students to pursue topics from a research group or personal or professional interest."

We chose to create a system comprised of a trough connected to two servo-controlled linear actuators. These would be used to control the position of either a ping-pong or golf ball laid in the trough. The ball's position would be measured by ultrasonic sensors; the system as a whole would be controlled by an Arduino system running Micropython.
